            In the vastness of space, humans have built a huge civilization that spreads across many planets. Earth is
            the center of it all, where leaders make important decisions. But there's trouble brewing.<br><br>

            A dangerous sickness is spreading everywhere. It doesn't care if you're on a distant planet or in the heart
            of Earth's cities. People are scared and looking for help.<br><br>

            They're turning to Earth and other strongholds for support. Scientists are working hard to find a cure, and
            doctors are risking their lives to help the sick. But it's tough. Supplies are running low, and some places
            are fighting over who gets what.<br><br>

            Even with all the problems, there are stories of bravery and kindness. Regular folks are stepping up to
            help, doing whatever they can to make things better.<br><br>

            As time goes on, things are getting harder. But people are holding on to hope. They know that as long as
            they stick together and keep trying, they can get through anything.<br><br>

            Hypertext Markup Language(HTML5) and Cascading Style Sheets(CSS3) are used for structuring and beautification of the webpages. Javascript is used to create more complicated animations and manipulate DOM and also facilitate better form validation.
            All animations have been developed to look futuristic in a tablet like view. The code has been tested on Google Chrome on screens ranging from 13.6inch to 17.6inch screens. Mobile support has not yet been implemented.
            Bootstrap CSS has been used for easier implementation and JQuery has been used for easier JS implementations.
            GitHub has been used for version control while github pages is used for website hosting.
